                I studied an Electrotechnical course at Fundação Liberato along
                with high school from 2017 to 2020. During the course, what
                caught my attention the most was the field of Automation, as I
                really enjoyed the logic that this area required.

                I started my internship in industrial automation projects in
                2021, and after being hired, I continued in this field until
                2023. During this time, I developed various operation screens
                for industrial process control and numerous logics for process
                automation.

                I became increasingly interested in the logic I used daily and

              <p class="activity-text">
                After a few semesters studying Computer Science, I decided to
                enter the field of programming and started an internship in
                software development. I learned a lot about technology during
                this period, especially about software development. I discovered
                that the Frontend area fascinates me the most, and I am
                determined to pursue a career in this field.
