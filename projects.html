              <strong>To-do List</strong> is a project that I developed to
              practice some React concepts, such as 'useState' and 'useEffect'.
              <br />
              <br />This project allows users to add, edit, remove, and mark
              tasks as completed. The user can also delete all items, to avoid
              unnecessary repetitive work.
              <br />
              <br />The board is designed to be expandable, so it has a default
              size, but if the user adds more items than the default size, the
              board expands accordingly while the background image remains
              fixed, only task board scrolls.
              <br />
              <br />The latest funcionality I added to this project is local
              storage. This ensures that if the user reloads the page, the tasks
              will still be saved.

              Pokémon.
              <br />
              <br />By clicking on the Pokémon's picture, a modal opens allowing
              the user to see the ability of that specific Pokémon.
              <br />
              <br />The image, name and the ability of the Pokémon are fetched
              directly from the API (it can be seen

              <strong>DescarTech</strong> is an app developed using React Native
              with the objective of reducing e-wast by reusing old devices or
              showing the places to discard them.
              <br />
              <br />There are some important screens:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Welcome page: users can log in or create a new account.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Feed page: users can see the devices and their descriptions.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. Product details page: users can see more information and
              pictures about the device.
              <br />
              <br />
              4. User profile page: users can see all the devices posted by a
              particular user.
              <br />
              <br />
              5. Map page: users can see the appropriate places to discard these
              kinds of devices. This page uses the Google Maps API and while the
              response is loading, a loader is displayed on the screen
              <br />
              <br />At this point, mocked data is being used.

              <strong>Capputeeno</strong> is the result of a frontend challenge
              (the challenge can be seen

              >). Creating this project allowed me to learn a lot about filters.
              <br />
              <br />The project is still in progress, but the main page is
              completed. Users can see all the products and filter them by
              category, by price or by typing the product name.
              <br />
              <br />The product details page is also completed and the users can
              see the price and description of the product.
